# Reflexes: Custom vs. SaaS

Suppose we had only one revenue stream: monthly fees associated with software as a service.

How would our we look at deals differently?

You might be thinking, "But we don't have just one revenue stream, so why should we isolate just this one?"

A couple of reasons: one financial, one technological. 

The financial reason goes like this: loss leaders should never involve long-term obligations. And this relates to the other: technology gets more complex over time, and complexity is expensive. 

In the past, we've eaten costs associated with technology in order to derive a profit from other revenue streams. The deals make sense at first, but the cost of maintaining and improving the technology eventually overwhelms the profit from professional services and rewards. 

One example was the Capital One program. A former president of the Loyalty company, Kelvin Taylor, was an actuarial scientist. He liked projections. His analysis showed that at some point in the future (this was about 2007), the Capital One project would begin losing money every month despite its rapid growth in members and rewards volume. The reason: we'd conceded a lot of the costs associated with technology in the original contract. The technology was becoming more complex by the day, driven by the client's wishes and by our own loyalty POV, which the client readily adopted. Even though Capital One was paying for project change acknowledgements (PCAs), the PCAs could not account for the increased cost of maintaining the more complex system. This complexity required ever more engineers and data ops people, and their costs were growing faster than the program itself. 

Which correlates to an old systems axiom: **the cost of increased complexity is exponential, usually by a factor of 3**. 

This is why our reflexes need to be retrained. The ever-increasing cost of complexity needs to be wrapped inside the basic economics of our system so that you, the seller, have solid numbers to work with in assessing a deal. 

And your assessment should never need to account for our ability to build something new in a time and budget you can talk the client into. Instead, your assessment of whether or not to pursue a deal should focus on just one question: **how long will this client stick with Maritz?**

In other words, a SaaS AE should focus only on the terms and conditions based on the **quality of a prospect's fit** with our capabilities and culture. The Sales Engineer is responsible for assessing the technical part of that fit, advising you on the likelihood of client success from a technical standpoint, and for closing the technical sale. Your number one question should be, "Will this client auto-renew three times?" Or four times? Or 10 times?

To explain why customer longevity is so important, here's a paragraph from an great book by a SaaS Customer Success expert, Lincoln Murphy, writing about Salesforce.com discovering it was in a death spiral:

> You can't pour enough business into the top of the funnel to sustain real growth if customers are leaking out the bottom at a high rate. Yes, you can show glowing growth rates for new customer acquisition, and that's a very good thing. But the allure and value of a recurring revenue business such as Salesforce is in growing the overall value of the installed base. That takes new customer acquisition plus high retention rates plus positive upsell results (selling more to existing customers). Only when all three of those gears are working do you have the healthy business engine that investors will reward.

### Conclusion

The reflexes associated with our old business model drove us to sell big bundles of many services. We focused on cost-plus to produce a GP figure that looked attractive to us, and a long list of products, services, and benefits to justify the price to the client. 

That model produced a two-step selling process. Part One happened before the stand-up. It involved a lot of blue-ocean thinking and ideation and was heavy on behavioral science theorizing. 

Part Two came after the stand-up, as we tried to put together a statement of work (SOW). In this phase, we first tried to figure out how we would actualize all the great ideas we came up with in Part Oneâ€”the shared vision of a wonderful new world this program and partnership would bring about. But we were usually constrained by *also* producing an exact replica of their old system and program. This actualization resulted in cost concerns. Each wrinkle of the shared vision required people to design, build, and maintain a slightly different version of some thing we've done for other clients in the past. These new versions might be technical, but they might also be catalogs, call centers, and any number of other products and services we provide. 

During Part Two is where we usually have the painful meetings on costs. We come up with ways to cut costs on the whiteboard, we speculate on things the client might be willing to do without, and we hope that all our theories and speculations actually work out. 

Put another way, we cross our fingers and hope for a miracle. And this produces months of anxiety:

* Will Engineering be able to build this in time?
* Will the client be okay with delaying launch?
* Will the client be okay with a leaderboard that shows only 5 people?

And the results were often less than spectacular:

* Engineering couldn't deliver that piece on time, because they ran into an unexpected complication.
* The client agreed to shift the launch date, but it's going to cost $100,000
* The client is not okay with a short leaderboard.
* Oh, and, by the way, that piece Engineering is building is going to cost three-times what was budgeted.

We've all been through this. We all know that the period from verbal acceptance to launch is a period of disappointment and stress. 

But it doesn't have to be that way. 

Selling SaaS won't eliminate all the problems associated with selling and onboarding a new client. Integrations are integrations. But selling SaaS can greatly reduce the stress.
