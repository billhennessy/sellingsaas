# Selling SaaS

A brief course for sales professionals seeking outstanding success selling B2B Software as a Service.

### What You'll Learn

**Developing Killer SaaS Selling Reflexes** Selling reflexes that work for selling software as a capital expense can hinder success as a SaaS sales professional. In this module, you'll learn to recognize those debilitating reflexes and replacing them with SaaS success reflexes.

**SaaS Financials** The financials of SaaS software center on lifetime value of a customer. Acquisition and closing deals is absolutely essential, but SaaS customers demand a lower barrier to exit. Your success as a SaaS sales professional depends on keeping customers around, not just closing the initial deal. 

**SaaS Selling Cycle** If you've been selling large software packages on an 18-month selling cycle, you'll be happy know the SaaS sales cycle can be much shorter, even if selling to the Fortune 500. But you need to manage the deal the right way to shorten the cycle, get the close, and hit this quarter's quota. You, the sales professional, must manage the cycle. This module will help.
